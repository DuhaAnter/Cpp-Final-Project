inside the update income function:



C++int choice;
cin >> choice;

// Clear leftover newline
cin.ignore(INT_MAX, '\n');
The problem in simple words
When the user types a number and presses Enter, two things actually go into the input buffer:
textUser types: 3   [Enter]
What goes into buffer:  '3'   '\n'   ← the newline character from pressing Enter

cin >> choice; reads only the number (3)
But it leaves the \n (Enter key) sitting in the input buffer!

Later in your program, when you do getline(cin, someString) (for example to read source or date),
getline sees that leftover \n and thinks:
"Oh, the user already pressed Enter → I'll read an empty line!"
→ Result: the program skips the next text input or reads empty string.
What each line really does
C++int choice;
cin >> choice;                  // reads the number (3), leaves \n in buffer
C++cin.ignore(INT_MAX, '\n');      // "Throw away everything until you find a newline (\n), and throw the \n too"

cin.ignore() = "ignore/discard characters"
INT_MAX = "ignore as many characters as possible" (very big number)
'\n' = "stop ignoring when you find the newline character"

So basically:
"Please clean up any leftover Enter key junk so the next input is clean"
